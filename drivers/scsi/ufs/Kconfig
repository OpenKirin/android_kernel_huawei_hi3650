config SCSI_UFSHCD
	tristate "Universal Flash Storage Controller Driver Core"
	depends on SCSI && SCSI_DMA
	---help---
	This selects the support for UFS devices in Linux, say Y and make
	  sure that you know the name of your UFS host adapter (the card
	  inside your computer that "speaks" the UFS protocol, also
	  called UFS Host Controller), because you will be asked for it.
	  The module will be called ufshcd.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/ufs.txt>.
	  However, do not compile this as a module if your root file system
	  (the one containing the directory /) is located on a UFS device.

config SCSI_UFSHCD_PCI
	tristate "PCI bus based UFS Controller support"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && PCI
	---help---
	This selects the PCI UFS Host Controller Interface. Select this if
	you have UFS Host Controller with PCI Interface.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM
	tristate "Platform bus based UFS Controller support"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD
	---help---
	This selects the UFS host controller support. Select this if
	you have an UFS controller on Platform bus.

	If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_QCOM
	bool "QCOM specific hooks to UFS controller platform driver"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM && ARCH_MSM
	select PHY_QCOM_UFS
	help
	  This selects the QCOM specific additions to UFSHCD platform driver.
	  UFS host on QCOM needs some vendor specific configuration before
	  accessing the hardware which includes PHY configuration and vendor
	  specific registers.

	  Select this if you have UFS controller on QCOM chipset.
	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_KIRIN
	  tristate "KIRIN UFS Host Controller Driver"
	  depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM
	  ---help---
	  This selects the KIRIN UFS host controller driver.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_KIRIN_LINERESET_CHECK
	  bool "KIRIN UFS background thread to check line-reset"
	  depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && SCSI_UFS_KIRIN
	  ---help---
	  This create a thread to check line-reset bug, and recovery it.

	  If using Kirin960, say Y here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_TEST
	tristate "Universal Flash Storage host controller driver unit-tests"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD
	---help---
	This adds UFS Host controller unit-test framework.
	The UFS unit-tests register as a block device test utility to
	the test-iosched and will be initiated when the test-iosched will
	be chosen to be the active I/O scheduler.

config SCSI_UFS_INLINE_CRYPTO
	tristate "UFS inline crytpo driver based on Kirin UFS Host Controller"
	depends on HISI_BLK_INLINE_CRYPTO && SCSI_UFSHCD && SCSI_UFS_KIRIN

	---help---
	This selects the Kirin UFS inline crypto driver.

	Select this if you want to use Hardware Crypto Engine
	and using its interface for some special cryto func.
	Otherwise, if you love my driver code, say Y or M here.

	If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_HS_ERROR_RECOVER
	tristate "UFS use this config to recover ufs hs error"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && SCSI_UFS_KIRIN

	---help---
	This selects the recovery of error in HS_MODE.

	Select this if needed to recover error in HS_MODE.

	If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_BLOCK_TEST
	tristate "Universal Flash Storage host controller driver unit-tests"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && IOSCHED_TEST
	---help---
	This adds UFS Host controller unit-test framework.
	The UFS unit-tests register as a block device test utility to
	the test-iosched and will be initiated when the test-iosched will
	be chosen to be the active I/O scheduler.
	
config HUAWEI_UFS_DSM
       bool "Listen UFS Kernel Error"
       depends on SCSI_UFSHCD

config UFS_DEVICE_RELATED_CONFIGS
       bool "Enable device related configs through dts"
       depends on SCSI_UFS_KIRIN && HUAWEI_UFS_DSM

config SCSI_UFS_KIRIN_V21
	  tristate "KIRIN V21 UFS Host Controller Driver"
	  depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM && SCSI_UFS_KIRIN
	  ---help---
	  This selects the KIRIN V21 UFS host controller driver.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.
